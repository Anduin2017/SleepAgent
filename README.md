Smart wristbands are basic electronic products that many people own nowadays. They have a wide variety of sensors that can collect a large amount of interesting data, such as sleep patterns, physical activity, and cardiovascular health. This data often has high analytical and development value.

For example, you can automatically activate the "do not disturb" mode on your phone after falling asleep and turn it off when you wake up. Or you can monitor your heart rate changes to control a treadmill for steady-state running. Or you can monitor blood oxygen saturation and send an alert when abnormalities occur.

So, it is very necessary to expand your smart wristband. And this repository provides a solution:

It supports the Amazfit GTR 4 wristband, running a background service in the wristband that scans the data of various sensors every 5 minutes and sends it to a custom HTTP server. Similarly, this repository also provides the HTTP data cache server.

Using this solution, you can perfectly retrieve your health data using HTTP API, use it for further expansion and development, or export it to Prometheus.

# Server side

## Run in Ubuntu

The following script will install\update this app on your Ubuntu server. Supports Ubuntu 22.04.

On your Ubuntu server, run the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://gitlab.aiursoft.cn/anduin/sleepagent/-/raw/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Of course it is suggested that append a custom port number to the command:

```bash
curl -sL https://gitlab.aiursoft.cn/anduin/sleepagent/-/raw/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s 8080
```

It will install the app as a systemd service, and start it automatically. Binary files will be located at `/opt/apps`. Service files will be located at `/etc/systemd/system`.

## Run manually

Requirements about how to run

1. Install [.NET 9 SDK](http://dot.net/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Execute `npm install` at `wwwroot` folder to install the dependencies.
3. Execute `dotnet run` to run the app.
4. Use your browser to view [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Run in Microsoft Visual Studio

1. Open the `.sln` file in the project path.
2. Press `F5` to run the app.

## Run in Docker

First, install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Then run the following commands in a Linux shell:

```bash
image=anduin2019/sleepagent
appName=sleepagent
sudo docker pull $image
sudo docker run -d --name $appName --restart unless-stopped -p 5000:5000 -v /var/www/$appName:/data $image
```

That will start a web server at `http://localhost:5000` and you can test the app.

The docker image has the following context:

| Properties  | Value                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Image       | anduin2019/sleepagent            |
| Ports       | 5000                             |
| Binary path | /app                             |
| Data path   | /data                            |
| Config path | /data/appsettings.json           |

# Sleep Agent full deployment

## Step 1 - Buy an Amazfit GTR 4

Of course you need to own a ZEPP watch to use this solution. Please buy the Amazfit GTR 4.

[京东](https://item.jd.com/100037094209.html)

Costs around 1000 RMB.

## Step 2 - Enable the developer mode

You need to enable the developer mode on your watch.

Go to `Settings` -> `About`, then tap the logo 10 times.

![enable developer mode](./assets/dev.png)

Now you can see the developer mode.

## Step 3 - Deploy the server (Optional if you want to use our server)

Of course, you need to deploy the server to store the sleep data.

Buy or deploy a Ubuntu 22.04 server. Deploy with any approaches above.

* Deploy with a single script
* Deploy manually
* Deploy with Docker

And get the server's endpoint. For example, `http://your-server.com`.

This will be the endpoint that the app will send the sleep data to.

## Step 4 - Change the endpoint in the app

You need to edit, build the app and install it on your phone.

First, install Node.js and NPM on your computer.

```bash
# Assuming you are using Windows
winget install -e --id Node.js
```

Then, install the ZEUS CLI tool:

```bash
npm i @zeppos/zeus-cli -g
```

Now change the endpoint to your own server's endpoint in the `./src/Anduin.SleepAgent.ClockApp/app-service/background_service.js` file.

```typescript
const endPoint = "http://your-server.com/api/metrics/send"
```

If you want to use our server, you can skip this step, or keep the value:

```typescript
const endPoint = "https://health.aiursoft.cn/api/metrics/send"
```

The app will send the sleep data to this endpoint.

## Step 5 - Build the app

Now, build the app:

```bash
cd ./src/Anduin.SleepAgent.ClockApp
npm install
zeus preview
```

Now you will see a QR code.

![shown-qr](./assets/qr.png)

## Step 6 - Install the app to your watch

Open the ZEPP app on your phone, and scan the QR code.

![install](./assets/install.jpg)

Now you can see the app on your watch's app list.

## Step 7 - Configure the app to send the data

Open the app on your watch, click the start button, and the app will start to send the sleep data to your server.

![app-running](./assets/running.png)

And you must disable the `Enable Sleep Mode` feature in the clock: `Sleep` -> `Settings` -> `Sleep Plan` -> `Enable Sleep Mode`. This is because the app will not work when the watch is in sleep mode.

And **NEVER** enter sleep mode for your watch!!! Because the app will stop working when the watch is in sleep mode.

## Step 8 - View the data on the server

Wait 5-10 minutes, and you can view the metrics data on your server.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server.com/api/metrics/all`.

If you are using our server, you can navigate to `https://health.aiursoft.cn/api/metrics/all`.

You will see the users list which has sent the sleep data to your server.

```json
[
    "SomeUser",
    "SomeOtherUser"
]
```

To view one user's data, navigate to `/api/metrics/query?nick-name=SomeUser`.

You may see:

```json

        }
    },
    "device": {
        "width": 466,

        "deepTime": 103, // Minutes
        "totalTime": 463 // Minutes
    },
    "sleepStgList": {
        "WAKE_STAGE": 7,
        "REM_STAGE": 8,
        "LIGHT_STAGE": 4,
        "DEEP_STAGE": 5
    },
    "SleepingStatus": 0, // 0: Awake, 1: Sleeping
    "stands": 5, // Times
    "standsT": 12, // Times
    "steps": 4461, // Steps

    "stress": {
        "value": 49,

    },
    "isWearing": 1 // 0: not wearing, 1: wearing, 2: in motion, 3: not sure
}
```

Now you can save the JSON or teleport it to other monitoring systems like Prometheus or Grafana.

## Step 9 - Scrap the data with Prometheus

You can scrap the data with Prometheus.

First, you need to create a new Prometheus server. You can start it with Docker:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name prometheus -p 9090:9090 -v /var/www/prometheus:/etc/prometheus prom/prometheus
```

Then, edit the `prometheus.yml` file:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 300s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: health
    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      - targets: [health.aiursoft.cn]
    metrics_path: /api/metrics/metric
    params:
      nick-name: ['AnduinXiaomi'] # Replace with your own user name
    scrape_interval: 300s
    honor_labels: true
```

Here I'm using the `health.aiursoft.cn` server, and I want to scrap the data of the user `AnduinXiaomi` as an example. You need to replace the server and user name with your own.

Then, restart the Prometheus server:

```bash
sudo docker restart prometheus
```

Now open the Prometheus server at `http://localhost:9090`, and you can see the metrics data.

## Step 10 - Visualize the data with Grafana

You can visualize the data with Grafana.

First, you need to create a new Grafana server. You can start it with Docker-compose.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start 3 docker containers:

* SleepAgent: The server that stores the sleep data. `http://localhost:5000`
* Prometheus: The server that scraps the sleep data. `http://localhost:9090`
* Grafana: The server that visualizes the sleep data. `http://localhost:3000`

![docker-compose](./assets/docker-compose.png)

Edit your clock app's settings, and change the endpoint to `http://YOUR_BOX:5000/api/metrics/send`.

Then, open the Grafana server at `http://localhost:3000`, login with account: `admin`, password: `admin`.

You will see the dashboard.
